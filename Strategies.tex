\chapter{Strategies}
\label{chap:Strategies}

\index{strategy|(}

\IceT contains several parallel image compositing algorithms.  The type of
compositing algorithm to use is selected by choosing a
\index{strategy}\keyterm{strategy}.  This chapter describes the underlying
algorithm of each strategy.  This user's guide will give qualitative
comparisons between the strategies, but for a more quantitative analysis,
see the following paper.

A strategy is specified using the \CFunc{icetStrategy} function.

\begin{Table}{3}
  \textC{void }\CFunc{icetStrategy}\textC{(}&\CType{IceTStrategy}&\CArg{strategy}\quad\textC{);}
\end{Table}

The \CArg{strategy} is set to one of the identifiers for the strategies
documented in the following sections of this chapter.  A string documenting
the current strategy can be retrieved with the \CFunc{icetGetStrategyName}
function.

To describe the \IceT compositing algorithms, we will use the example
parallel rendering problem shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ExampleInputs} where 6
processes are each rendering their own piece of a shuttle model to a two
tile display.

  \caption[Example compositing problem.]{An example of six processes
    rendering to two tiles (top) and their composited image (bottom).}
  \label{fig:ExampleInputs}
\end{figure}

In this example, processes are denoted, in no particular order, by the
colors gray, red, blue, green, purple, and orange.  The colors of the
geometry correspond to the process that generated each piece.  Image
boarder colors denote the process that generates and holds that image.
(Apologies to those having troubles resolving the colors due to poor
display or vision deficiencies.  It should not be hard to follow the
descriptions either way.)

\section{Single Image Compositing}

Before discussing the multi-tile image compositing algorithms implemented
by \IceT, we visit the standard single image compositing algorithms.  You
cannot directly select a single image compositing algorithm as a strategy
(most of the multi-tile algorithms work well in ``single-tile'' mode), but
these compositing algorithms are used as ``subroutines'' in some of the
multi-tile algorithms.  A reference to a
\index{single~image~composite~network}\keyterm{single image composite
  network} in the subsequent compositing algorithm descriptions refers to
the algorithms described here.

\IceT internally has two single image composite implementations.  The first
of which is the \keyterm{tree composite} algorithm (sometimes also called
binary tree composite due to its group-wise pairing).  The basic network
for tree composite is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BinaryTree}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{images/BinaryTree}
  \caption[Tree composite network.]{Tree composite network.  Arrows
    represent the passing of data from one stage to the next.  Processes
    receiving multiple images composite them together.}
  \label{fig:BinaryTree}
\end{figure}

The tree compositing algorithm is organized in stages.  At each stage the
processes pair up.  One of the processes sends its data to its pair and
then drops out of the computation.  The receiving process combines the two
images (using the \index{compositing~operation}compositing operation
described in
Chapter~\ref{sec:Customizing_Compositing:Compositing_Operation}) and
continues to the next stage.  Processing continues until there is only one
image (and one process) remaining.

As just defined, the tree composite algorithm only handles process that are
a power of two (that is, the number of processes is equal to $2^i$ for some
integer $i$).  \IceT handles non-powers of two gracefully.  At any stage
where the number of processes is not even and one of the processes cannot
be paired, that leftover process does nothing for that stage but then
continues to participates in the next stage.  An example of this can be
seen in the second stage of Figure~\ref{fig:BinaryTree}.

The advantages of tree composite are its regular and efficient data
transfers.  The limiting factor of tree compositing is that at each stage of the
algorithm half of the
