    It would appear that many projects carried out at the national
    DOE laboratories could benefit from some dry-erase markers. This
    report examines the requirements for the use of dry-erase markers
    and gives a few specific examples on how dry-erase markers can
    be used to advance the state of the art.

    Before we start exploring the exciting world of dry-erase
    markers, we need a test paragraph so we can check paragraph
    formating in the abstract.  Pay attention to the indentation
    and spacing of these two paragraphs. The \emph{strict} option
    controls this.
