  \mansection{Description}

  The \icetEnable and \icetDisable functions turn various \IceT features on
  and off.  \CArg{pname} is a symbolic constant representing the feature to
  be turned on or off.  Valid values for \CArg{pname} are:

  \begin{Description}[xxxxxxxx]
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_CORRECT\_COLORED\_BACKGROUND}] Colored backgrounds are
    problematic when performing color blended compositing in that the
    background color will be additively blended from each image.  Enabling
    this flag will internally cause the color to be reset to black and then
    cause the color to be blended back into the resulting images.  This
    flag is disabled by default.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_DISPLAY}] If enabled, the final, composited image for
    each tile is written back to the frame buffer before the return of
    \CFunc{icetDrawFrame}.  This flag is enabled by default.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_DISPLAY\_COLORED\_BACKGROUND}] If this and
    \CEnum{ICET\_DISPLAY} are enabled, uses \OpenGL blending to ensure that
    all background is set to the correct color.  This flag is disabled by
    default.  This option does not affect the images returned from
    \icetGetColorBuffer or \icetGetDepthBuffer; it only affects the image
    in the \OpenGL color buffer.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_DISPLAY\_INFLATE}] If this and \CEnum{ICET\_DISPLAY}
    are enabled and the renderable window is larger then the displayed tile
    (as determined by the current \OpenGL viewport), then resample the
    image to fit within the renderable window before writing back to frame
    buffer.  This flag is disabled by default.  This option does not affect
    the images returned from \icetGetColorBuffer or \icetGetDepthBuffer; it
    only affects the image in the OpenGL color buffer.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_DISPLAY\_INFLATE\_WITH\_HARDWARE}] This option
    determines how images are inflated.  When enabled (the default), images
    are inflated by creating a texture and allowing the hardware the
    inflate the image.  When disabled, images are inflated on the CPU.
    This option has no effect unless both \CEnum{ICET\_DISPLAY} and
    \CEnum{ICET\_DISPLAY\_INFLATE} are also enabled.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_FLOATING\_VIEWPORT}] If enabled, the projection will
    be shifted such that the geometry will be rendered in one shot whenever
    possible, even if the geometry straddles up to four tiles.  This flag
    is enabled by default.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_ORDERED\_COMPOSITE}] If enabled, the image composition
    will be performed in the order specified by the last call to
    \CFunc{icetCompositeOrder}, assuming the current strategy (specified by
    a call to \CFunc{icetStrategy}) supports ordered composition.
    Generally, you want to enable ordered compositing if doing color
    blending and disable if you are doing z-buffer comparisons.  If
    enabled, you should call \CFunc{icetCompositeOrder} between each frame
    to update the image order as camera angles change.  This flag is
    disabled by default.
  \end{Description}


  \mansection{Errors}

  \begin{Description}[ICET\_INVALID\_OPERATION]
  \item[\CErrorEnum{ICET\_INVALID\_VALUE}] If \CArg{pname} is not a feature
    to be enabled or disabled.
  \end{Description}


  \mansection{Warnings}

  None.


  \mansection{Bugs}

  The check for a valid \CArg{pname} is not thorough, and thus the
  \CEnum{ICET\_INVALID\_VALUE} error may not always be raised.
