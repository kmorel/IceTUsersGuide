  \mansection{Synopsis}

  \textC{\#include <IceT.h>}

  \begin{Table}{3}
    \textC{void }\CFunc{icetTemplate}\textC{(}&\CType{IceTColorBuffer}&\CArg{cb}\textC{,} \\
      &\CType{IceTDepthBuffer}&\CArg{db}\quad\textC{);}
  \end{Table}

  
  \mansection{Description}

  The \CFunc{icetTemplate} function does not really exist.  I made it up.
  You won't find it in \textC{IceT.h}, so don't look.  Don't try to
  use it or your program will not compile or link.

  Here is a list of other functions that do not exist.

  \begin{Description}[xxxxxxxx]
  \item[\CFunc{icetNon}] If less is more, then this funciton is
    everything since it is, in fact, nothing.
  \item[\CFunc{icetRubberBiscuit}] What do you want for nothing?  A
    rubber biscuit?  Mmmm... rubber biscuit.
  \end{Description}

  And that's that.  Nothing more to say, really.


  \mansection{Return Value}

  Don't you see the \textC{void}?


  \mansection{Errors}

  \end{Description}
