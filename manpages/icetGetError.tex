  \mansection{Synopsis}

  \textC{\#include <IceT.h>}

  \begin{Table}{3}
    \textC{GLenum }\CFunc{icetGetError}\textC{(}&\textC{void}&\textC{);}
  \end{Table}

  
  \mansection{Description}

  Retrieves the first error or warning condition that occurred since the
  last call to \CFunc{icetGetError} or since program startup, whichever
  happened last.

  Once an error condition has been retrieved with \CFunc{icetGetError}, the
  error condition is reset to no error and cannot be retrieved again.


  \mansection{Return Value}

  One of the following flags will be returned:
  \begin{Description}[ICET\_INVALID\_OPERATION]
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_INVALID\_VALUE}] An inappropriate value has been
    passed to a function.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_INVALID\_OPERATION}] An inappropriate function has
    been called.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY}] \IceT has ran out of memory for
    buffer space.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_BAD\_CAST}] A function has been passed a value of the
    wrong type.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_INVALID\_ENUM}] A function has been passed an invalid
    constant.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_SANITY\_CHECK\_FAIL}] An internal error (or warning)
    has occurred.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_NO\_ERROR}] No error has been raised since the last
    call to \CFunc{icetGetError}.
  \end{Description}


  \mansection{Bugs}

  It is not possible to tell if the returned value was caused by an error
  or a warning.


  \mansection{Notes}

  The error value is \emph{not} context dependent.
