  \mansection{Synopsis}

  \textC{\#include <GL/ice-t\_mpi.h>}

  \begin{Table}{3}
    \textC{void }\CFunc{icetDestroyMPICommunicator}\textC{(}&\CType{IceTCommunicator}&\CArg{comm}\quad\textC{);}
  \end{Table}

  
  \mansection{Description}

  Destroys an \CType{IceTCommunicator}.  \CArg{comm} becomes invalid and
  any memory or MPI resources held by \CArg{comm} are freed.

  Communicators are copied when attached to an \IceT context, so destroying
  an \CType{IceTCommunicator} used to create a context still in use is
  safe.


  \mansection{Errors}

  None.


  \mansection{Warnings}

  None.


  \mansection{Bugs}

  All MPI errors are ignored.
