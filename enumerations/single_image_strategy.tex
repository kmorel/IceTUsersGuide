\begin{Description}
\item[\CEnum{ICET\_SINGLE\_IMAGE\_STRATEGY\_AUTOMATIC}] Automatically
  chooses which single image strategy to use based on the number of
  processes participating in the composition.
  \index{single~image~strategy!automatic}
\item[\CEnum{ICET\_SINGLE\_IMAGE\_STRATEGY\_BSWAP}] The classic binary swap
  compositing algorithm.  At each phase of the algorithm, each process
  partners with another, sends half of its image to its partner, and
  receives the opposite half from its partner.  The processes are then
  partitioned into two groups that each have the same image part, and the
  algorithm recurses.

\item[\CEnum{ICET\_SINGLE\_IMAGE\_STRATEGY\_TREE}] At each phase, each
  process partners with another, and one of the processes sends its entire
  image to the other.  The algorithm recurses with the group of processes
  that received images until only one process has an image.
