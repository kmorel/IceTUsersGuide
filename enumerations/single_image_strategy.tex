\begin{Description}
\item[\CEnum{ICET\_SINGLE\_IMAGE\_STRATEGY\_AUTOMATIC}] Automatically
  chooses which single image strategy to use based on the number of
  processes participating in the composition.
  \index{single~image~strategy!automatic}
\item[\CEnum{ICET\_SINGLE\_IMAGE\_STRATEGY\_BSWAP}] The classic binary swap
  compositing algorithm.  At each phase of the algorithm, each process
  partners with another, sends half of its image to its partner, and
  receives the opposite half from its partner.  The processes are then
  partitioned into two groups that each have the same image part, and the
  algorithm recurses.

\item[\CEnum{ICET\_SINGLE\_IMAGE\_STRATEGY\_RADIXK}] The radix-k
  acompositing algorithm is similar to binary swap except that groups of
  processes can be larger than two.  Larger groups require more overall
  messages but overlap blending and communication.  The size of the groups
  is indirectly controlled by the \CEnum{ICET\_MAGIC\_K} environment
  variable or CMake variable.
\item[\CEnum{ICET\_SINGLE\_IMAGE\_STRATEGY\_TREE}] At each phase, each
  process partners with another, and one of the processes sends its entire
  image to the other.  The algorithm recurses with the group of processes
  that received images until only one process has an image.
