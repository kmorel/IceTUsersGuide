  \begin{Description}[ICET\_IMAGE\_COLOR\_RGBA\_UBYTE]
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_IMAGE\_COLOR\_RGBA\_UBYTE}] Each entry is an RGBA
    color tuple.  Each component is valued in the range from $0$ to $255$
    and is stored as an 8-bit integer.  The buffer will always be allocated
    on memory boundaries such that each color value can be treated as a
    single 32-bit integer.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_IMAGE\_COLOR\_RGBA\_FLOAT}] Each entry is an RGBA
    color tuple.  Each component is in the range from $0.0$ to $1.0$ and is
    stored as a 32-bit float.
  \item[\CEnum{ICET\_IMAGE\_COLOR\_NONE}] No color values are stored in the
    image.
